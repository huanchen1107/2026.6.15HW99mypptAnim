description: Convert an image-only slide deck (NotebookLM-style PPTX/PDF where every slide is one flat image) into an animated MP4 with TTS narration and subtitles. Segments each slide into element layers (cards, arrows, charts, highlight groups), schedules layer entrances from the narration timeline, previews in the browser, and renders via ffmpeg. Use when the user wants slide images turned into a narrated/animated video.

# PPTX → Animated Narrated Video

Treat every slide as a flat image — never assume editable PowerPoint elements.
All scripts run **from the project root** (they read/write `output/`, `audio/`,
`narration/`, `hyperframes/`, `final/` under the cwd).

## Prerequisites

```
pip install opencv-python pymupdf pillow edge-tts
```
ffmpeg: system install, or `npm i ffmpeg-static ffprobe-static` in the project,
or set `FFMPEG_PATH`. Scripts auto-discover it.

## Workflow

`SKILL_DIR` = this skill's folder; run scripts as `python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/<name>.py"`.

1. **Slides → PNG**: need a PDF (export PPTX to PDF if necessary), then
   `render_slides.py deck.pdf` → `output/slide_##/original.png` (1920x1080).
2. **Write the narration** `narration/narration_script.md` yourself (the model)
   after looking at every slide image. Format — one section per slide:
   ```
   ## Slide 01 - <title>

   <口語化、教學型旁白，2-4 句>
   ```
   Match the deck's language (zh-TW deck → 繁體中文旁白). Pace ≈ 130–160
   chars/min; each slide's text should speak in roughly 10–16 s.
3. **TTS**: `tts_edge.py [voice] [rate]` (defaults: `zh-TW-HsiaoChenNeural`,
   rate `-8%` — teaching pace). Pass a different voice for other languages.
   For a snappier delivery use `+38%` (≈1.5× the default speech speed) or
   higher; the user has previously asked for 1.5× faster narration. Audio
   durations drive all timing, so do this BEFORE segmenting. If running from
   a subdirectory and `audio_duration` returns None, the scripts couldn't
   find ffprobe — create a junction to the project's `node_modules`, e.g.:
   ```
   New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path .\node_modules `
     -Target ..\node_modules
   ```
4. **Segment**: `segment_elements.py [slide numbers]`. Prints per-slide layer
   count and a reconstruction diff — **any nonzero diff is a bug, stop and fix**.
   Outputs per slide: transparent layers + `background.png` + `metadata.json`,
   plus review artifacts:
   - `work_preview/element_debug/slide_##_debug.jpg` — original / detected
     boxes / background-after-cut / reconstruction
   - `work_preview/slide_##_layer_gallery.jpg` — each layer on a checkerboard
     with name/type/position/start time
5. **Review loop (do not skip)**: read several galleries yourself, then show
   the user the galleries for the most complex slides and ask if the cuts
   match their expectation. Iterate on `segment_elements.py` thresholds until
   approved. Re-run is cheap; renders are not.
6. **Timeline**: `build_timeline.py` → `narration_timing.json`, SRT/VTT,
   `hyperframes/` browser preview. Preview: `python -m http.server 8080` →
   `http://localhost:8080/hyperframes/index.html`.
7. **Render — only after the user approves the cuts** (it's the expensive
   step): `render_final_video.py` → `final/final_video_with_voiceover.mp4` +
   burned-subtitles version. Run it in the background; it prints one line per
   slide.

## Quality bar for segmentation (learned from human review)

- **Human reading logic rules everything.** Title first, then rows top-to-
  bottom, left-to-right inside a row (row clustering by vertical centre — not
  fixed bands, they misorder at boundaries). On two-panel layouts **left
  panel must fully reveal before the right panel** — the default row-cluster
  sort already does this once each panel is one layer.
- **A sentence is ONE layer.** Never let words of one sentence appear as
  separate animated pieces. Word-gap merging must scale with font size
  (large display fonts have 35px+ word spacing).
- **Cards/flow boxes/tables/PANELS** are detected via enclosed interiors
  (holes in the ink mask, `cv2.RETR_CCOMP` children). Hand-drawn arrows touch
  box borders and defeat plain connected components, so the hole+border test
  is the only reliable signal. Adjacent table cells merge into one table.
  Size cap is 0.48×slide-area (NOT 0.35) so half-slide bounded regions like
  side-by-side "comparison" panels qualify as single panel-cards. Outer slide
  chrome is still rejected by the 0.9-width / 0.9-height caps.
- **A "collage" is ONE illustration.** A `collage_cluster` pass after the
  word/line merge groups 3+ pieces that touch or sit within 80px with axis
  overlap, where the joint bbox is ≤30% of slide, piece-bbox density is
  ≥30%, aspect ratio ≤4, and **raw ink ratio inside the bbox is ≥0.17**.
  That last threshold separates a real visual pile (paper pile measured
  ~0.19) from a structured icon-over-caption grid (~0.14). Cross-column
  corridor between two pieces still vetoes the merge so grid layouts don't
  collapse.
- **Stamps/highlights default to merging into the underlying element.**
  REJECTED stamps, approval marks, hand-drawn highlights are visually part
  of the thing they mark — let the collage/card pass include them. Only
  carve them out as their own layer when the user explicitly asks (use
  `exclude_red` in the OVERRIDES merge spec).
- **Arrows/icons/loose text** come from the ink that remains after erasing
  card rects — that's what keeps card-border slivers out of arrow crops.
  Dashed arrows need the dash-chain rule (small fragments, gap < ~42px).
- **Red circle/doodle/note over a card** → one `highlight_group` with that
  card. It must not be torn apart, and must not swallow neighbouring cards
  (zero the alpha over other cards' rects, keeping only red ink there).
- **Red annotations drawn on charts/tables** (note text + vector arrow/
  star/circle) become separate `annotation` layers with stroke-mask alpha
  (include the faint anti-aliased skirt or you get pink ghosts + broken
  glyphs), whitened out of the chart crop, fading in ~0.85s after the
  chart. Distinguish from same-coloured data curves by stroke thickness
  (≥6px half-width) and glyph size (≤70px); curves are thinner and wider.
- **Axis labels belong to the chart** (rotated y-label, x caption, ticks).
- **Tiny/thin fragments touching a card** (area <2000px² or min side <26px)
  are border residue — fold them back into the card. Real small elements
  (flow arrows ~55x39) sit clear of cards and stay separate.
- **Trim, don't blindly absorb, when a piece grazes a card.** The trim/
  absorb step (`segment_elements.py` end of `detect_elements`) absorbs a
  non-card piece into an overlapping card when the cut needed to remove the
  overlap is large enough to mean "this piece really continues inside the
  card". But the threshold must be fraction-of-piece, NOT a fixed pixel
  count — a wide footer banner grazing the bottom of a panel-card by 15px
  (12% of the footer's 124px height) would otherwise be absorbed and
  inflate the card across the whole slide. Rule: `cut > 14 AND cut > 0.20 *
  perpendicular_dim`.
- **Watermarks** (e.g. NotebookLM, bottom-right) stay in the background.
- **Verification is non-negotiable**: compositing background + all layers
  must reproduce the original with 0 px diff (>20 intensity) on every slide.

### Per-slide OVERRIDES vs algorithm changes

The `OVERRIDES` dict at the top of `segment_elements.py` is the escape hatch
for slides whose ground truth doesn't generalize cleanly. **Prefer fixing the
algorithm over adding an override** — the user wants this pipeline to be a
reusable skill, not a per-deck hack. Add an override only when the same
pattern would mis-fire on another deck if generalized. Each entry can specify
`merge` boxes, `suppress` regions, `order` regions, `tight`/`exclude_red`/
`absorb`/`type` flags on a merge.

## Timing rules

- Narration first: each slide's duration = its voiceover length + 0.55s;
  layer starts spread across the narration window; 0.5s crossfade between
  slides. Animations: title fade-in-down, cards fade-in-up, arrows wipe-in,
  icons pop-in, charts draw-in, annotations fade-in (no movement — they sit
  over whitened pixels).
- If there is no TTS available, still produce script/subtitles/timing and a
  README explaining how to plug in ElevenLabs/Azure/OpenAI/Google TTS; do not
  block the pipeline.

## Rendering and subtitle burn

- After threshold tweaks: re-run segment + timeline + galleries only.
  **Never re-render the MP4s unless the user asks** — say the videos are now
  stale and give the one-command re-render instead. If only the subtitle
  style or SRT changed (no audio/layer changes), re-burn just the subtitle
  pass on the existing unsubbed MP4 — much faster than re-rendering:
  ```
  ffmpeg -i final/final_video_with_voiceover.mp4 -vf "scale=...,pad=...,subtitles=..." \
    -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 18 -c:a copy \
    final/final_video_with_voiceover_and_subtitles.mp4
  ```
- Subtitle burn — **letterbox the slide into the top 960px** so a 120px
  dark band at the bottom is dedicated to subtitles. Decks routinely have
  content (footer banners, sub-questions, alert boxes) hugging the bottom
  of the slide; letterboxing means subtitles can NEVER overlap that
  content, no matter the deck. The unsubbed `final_video_with_voiceover.mp4`
  stays full-size — only the subbed version letterboxes:
  ```
  -vf "scale=1920:960,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=0x101010,
       subtitles=narration/subtitles.srt:force_style='FontName=Microsoft JhengHei,
       FontSize=11,PrimaryColour=&H00FFFFFF,BorderStyle=3,Outline=8,Shadow=0,
       BackColour=&H66000000,MarginL=30,MarginR=30,MarginV=10'"
  ```
  (ASS sizes are relative to 288-line script resolution; 16+ overflows the
  frame.) `BorderStyle=3` + a semi-transparent `BackColour` paints a dark
  box behind the text. `Outline=8` widens the box padding around the
  glyphs. The 1920:960 scale is a mild ~11% vertical squish — viewers
  rarely notice, and the band gives the subtitle a clean home.
  **libass alpha is inverted**: `00` = fully opaque, `FF` = fully
  transparent — so `PrimaryColour=&H00FFFFFF` is opaque white and
  `BackColour=&H66000000` is a ~60%-opaque black box. Getting this wrong
  (e.g. `&HFFFFFFFF` for white) makes the text invisible.

## Subtitle chunking (a sentence is NOT a cue)

`build_timeline.py` splits each slide's narration into short cues, NOT one
giant cue per slide. The previous "one cue per slide" form produced 12-23s
blocks of 100-160 CJK chars that wrapped to 4-5 lines and climbed into the
slide content area. The chunker (`chunk_narration`):

1. Split on sentence endings (`。！？`).
2. If any sentence is still over `SUB_CHUNK_MAX = 32` CJK chars, split
   further on clause boundaries (`，：；、`), greedily packing clauses up to
   the limit.
3. Time each chunk proportionally to its char count within the slide's
   speech window (slide end minus 0.35s tail silence).

The result is 1-2 line subtitles that read in sync with the speech. Keep
`SUB_CHUNK_MAX` around 30-36 for CJK; bump higher for languages with
shorter character counts per spoken second.
