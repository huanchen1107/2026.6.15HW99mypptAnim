"""Element-level segmentation for image-based slides.

Cuts each slide into animatable element layers:
- individual cards / flow boxes (box border + inner text as one layer)
- individual arrows
- icons, charts, standalone text blocks
- highlight groups: red circle / annotation overlapping an element is merged
  with that element into a single layer instead of being torn apart

Run from the project root (the directory containing output/). Slides must
already exist as output/slide_##/original.png (see render_slides.py).
If audio/slide_##_voiceover.mp3 exists its duration drives the slide timing.

Usage: python segment_elements.py [slide numbers...]
